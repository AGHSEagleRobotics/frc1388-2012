Need to set motor speed to "0" in the "End" of a command:
-MoveTipper -> does the motor need to stop?
-DriveWithJoystick -> I don't know if this ends.. but you might want it just in case.


From Review Session:
-AutoAim for Turret
-Everything else for turret.
-Fire needs to be updated.
-Add moveup and movedown commands.
-Add command "ManualTurretControl" manual control will override autoAim
-Observe and implement how inturrupting functions work and how manual/auto
 will exchange.
